# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, which is well-suited for handling sequential data. By training on historical stock prices, the LSTM model 
identifies complex patterns and temporal dependencies, providing predictive insights into future stock trends. Stock price prediction is essential for informed decision-making in finance, where accurate forecasts 
can lead to substantial gains or minimize losses.

## About LSTM

LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to remember information over long sequences, making it especially useful for time-series data like stock prices. Traditional RNNs struggle with long-term 
dependencies due to the “vanishing gradient” problem. LSTMs overcome this by incorporating memory cells and gate structures—input, forget, and output gates—that regulate the information flow, retaining essential 
information over extended periods while discarding irrelevant data. This design allows LSTMs to learn patterns in sequential data, such as the rising and falling trends of stock prices over time.

## Key Features of LSTM:

- Memory Cells: Preserve context over long sequences, enabling the model to remember past price trends.
- Gate Mechanisms: Regulate the flow of information, helping the model decide what to keep or forget.
- Temporal Dependency: Ideal for capturing long-term dependencies and trends in time-series data, such as stock prices.

## Model Architecture

### Data Preprocessing:
- **Scaling**: Features are scaled using `MinMaxScaler` to fit values between 0 and 1.
- **Sequencing**: Data is structured into sequences to feed into the LSTM model.

### LSTM Layers:
- **Input Layer**: Sequential data of stock prices.
- **LSTM Layers**: Multiple LSTM layers with `relu` activation to learn temporal dependencies.
- **Dense Layer**: A fully connected layer to output the stock price prediction.

### Training:
- **Epochs**: The model is trained over multiple epochs with a low learning rate to ensure convergence.
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to measure prediction accuracy.

# Other Stock Prediction Methods
In addition to LSTM, several other methods can be applied to predict stock prices:

- **Simple Moving Averages (SMA)**: Calculates the average price over a period, helpful in identifying trends.
- **ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A statistical approach that models time-series data based on past values.
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**: A simplified version of LSTM that may perform well on simpler datasets.
- **Transformer Models**: Newer architectures that use attention mechanisms and can handle sequential data with improved efficiency, especially useful for large datasets.
